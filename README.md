# 🚦 Traffic Flow Optimization Using Computer Vision

This project aims to optimize traffic signal timing using real-time computer vision and image analysis. By detecting the number of vehicles at each traffic signal, the system dynamically allocates green light duration based on real-time congestion levels, improving traffic flow and reducing unnecessary waiting times.

## 📌 Features

- 🧠 Vehicle detection using computer vision (YOLO, OpenCV, or similar)
- 🎥 Real-time video/image feed processing
- ⏱️ Adaptive signal timing based on vehicle count
- 📊 Logs and displays traffic density for analysis
- ⚙️ Scalable to multi-lane and multi-signal intersections

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **OpenCV**
- **YOLO / TensorFlow / any preferred object detection model**
- **NumPy / Pandas**
- **Flask** (optional: for web dashboard/API)
- **Raspberry Pi / Jetson Nano** (optional: for edge deployment)

## 📷 How It Works

1. **Capture Input:** Live video feed from traffic signal cameras.
2. **Detect Vehicles:** Use object detection to count vehicles per lane.
3. **Calculate Signal Time:** More vehicles = longer green light time.
4. **Control Signal:** Send control signal to traffic lights accordingly.
5. **Repeat in Real-Time.**
